# Contributing Guides

Fork this repo, and add any tools, or tech stuffs that you find useful to the related files or topics, feel free to add new topics, new topics are to be added in a seperate file.

All topics should have a first line as `# Topic name`, This is the heading that will be placed in the Readme file when you generate the readme.md using create-toc.sh

For eg
awesome-angular.md file should have in the first line,  

```
# Awesome Angular tools and resources
```

Everytime you create a new topics or files you should generate the table of content by executing `./create-toc.sh`

Now readme.md will be newly created, and dont forget to add and commit that to the repo.
